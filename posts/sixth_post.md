# Recursive Patterns and Fractal Shapes

Recursion is a powerful concept in coding that revolves around self-reference. It allows us to create functions that call themselves, when applied in net art, recursion becomes an invaluable tool for generating intricate and mesmerizing visuals.

One particular application of recursion that fascinated me was the creation of fractal trees. Fractals are self-similar shapes, meaning they exhibit the same pattern at different scales. By learning how to create recursive functions, I was able to generate visually complex fractal trees.

Drawing inspiration from algorithmic botany, I delved into simulating the growth of plants using code. Algorithmic botany explores the mathematical patterns and processes behind plant development, allowing us to recreate them digitally. Through experiments conducted in p5.js and Processing, I was able to mimic the growth patterns of real plants.

One of the most captivating experiments I conducted was the creation of a Barnsley Fern, a type of fractal fern, in Processing. By utilizing the principles of algorithmic botany and the recursive nature of fractals, I was able to generate an intricate fern composed of countless smaller ferns. 

By combining the principles of recursion, algorithmic botany, and creative coding, I am able to create net art that is visually captivating and conceptually rich. Through the fusion of coding and artistry, net art becomes a medium for exploring the interconnectedness of nature, mathematics, and human creativity.
