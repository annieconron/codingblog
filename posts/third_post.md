This week I learnt how to create classes and arrays. 

# Classes 
A class is a new block of code that encapsulates everything about an object. All these properties will go inside this new block of code so that in the main program, which has set up and draw, we don't have to write the code for the object.

**A helpful way that the coding train defined a class is:**
- The class is the cookie cutter, aka the template for what the bubble actually is 
- The object/instance is the cookie - the thing itself

# Array 
**Through the coding train tutorials I have learnt how to create objects** - a collection of properties - **and placing functions within the object** - to issue commands to this thing/object that has a number of properties.

Using arrays I have learnt how to take a single object and duplicate it. 

So an array is a list of values, separated by commas, embedded inside of open and closed square brackets. This is similar to the idea of having an object - which is a collection of name value pairs, inside of curly brackets - both of these are collections, lists of name value pairs or lists of values etc.

The key distinction is that the order of the array list is what matters. 
- Elements in an array have an index - a value in the array could be the first element of the third etc
- The ability to have the elements in an order is a crucial and key aspect of an array
