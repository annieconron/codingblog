# Exploring Net Art: Unleashing Effective Complexity with Coding Skills

Net art is a form of digital art that utilizes the internet as its canvas and offers a unique platform for artists to express their creativity. 
Effective complexity refers to the creation of intricate and visually compelling digital artworks. It involves combining elements such as images, text, interactivity and dynamic visuals to evoke emotions and deeper contemplation of the work. Coding skills play a crucial role in achieving effective complexity, enabling artists to manipulate and transform various digital components seamlessly.

One of my favourite examples of net art is Mark Napier's Shredder (1998). This artwork embodies the concept of deconstruction and fragmentation, where the artist utilizes coding techniques to transform websites entered into the search field. Similar to a physical paper shredder that disassembles documents into tiny pieces, "Shredder" scatters markup, images, links, and text across the webpage, creating a visualy complex and interactive experience.

These are images I created by entering the website url for MOMA and Tublr

This example displays how data manipulation can be used in net art, whether it's text, images, or real-time information, to dynamically generate visuals and create immersive experiences that respond to changing inputs or external factors.
