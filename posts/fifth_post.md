One of my favourite examples of net art is Mark Napier's Shredder (1998), which deconstructs the websites that are keyed into the search field. A paper shredder is designed to transform whole document into tiny deconstructed pieces, similarly, this program fragments and scatters markup, images, links and text across the webpage.
